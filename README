The main difficulty I faced was storing the digits. I did not want to waste any space or runtime, so I decide the bets way to store would be with a boolean flag indicating if the bigint is in forwards or reverse order. Unfortunately, this meant that I had 4 times as many cases when dealing with addition, subtraction, and comparisons (possibilities: (f,f) (f,r), (r,f), (r,r).

Just use the 'make' command and the code should run.

I also don't know why, but login to the cs-class.uis.georgetown just wasn't working for me, as it would just take in the information and never prompt me for the password. 


Also sorry for the lack of comments and bad readability, I had a lot of test cases and was running short on time. I will try to bring a commented copy of the code to the code review. Thanks!
